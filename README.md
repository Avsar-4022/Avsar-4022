# THE CODE PREDATOR

*Carving through code with ruthless precision.*

---

## Identity
Forged in the relentless battlefield of bugs and broken code, I tear through challenges with surgical precision. Every error is a target, every project a mission.

---

## Arsenal of Tools
- **Python:** Stealth and precision.
- **C:** High-performance and low-level mastery.

---

## Manifesto
I don't just write code. I engineer revolutions in every line. Mediocrity is a weaknessâ€”I strike with unyielding rigor and innovate where others hesitate.

## Battle Scars
- **Semester Project:** A relentless pursuit of hardware-software integration in Arduino. [GitHub Project](https://github.com/Avsar-4022/Air-Quality-Monitoring-System)

## The Challenge
Enter my realm. Collaborate, confront, or simply witness the surge of uncompromised coding.
